# Linear Regression
Applied Linear Regression model on a data set of cars containing their brand names, year, mileage, engine volume etc. The model used a 80/20 split and acheived a R2 score of around 0.75 indicating that 75 percent of our predictions were on point!

* Before you run it in your system, make sure that the name of the csv file is the same as that in the second cell of the Jupyter Notebook.

The same can be viewed on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/harisrehmanhh/first-linear-regression)
